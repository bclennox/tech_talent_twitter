Tech Talent Twitter
===================

This is an example Rails application that we'll use for reference while we build a "Twitter clone".


Installation
------------

1. Clone the app: `git clone https://github.com/bclennox/tech_talent_twitter.git`
2. Change into the directory: `cd tech_talent_twitter`
3. Install the gems: `bundle install`
4. Set up the database: `rake db:setup`
5. Start the server: `rails s`

Then you should be able to visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and see it in action!
